## Recent Experience

### [RetailMeNot](http://www.retailmenot.com/), Austin TX, March 2014-Present

#### Data Science Team, August 2016-Present

Principal Software Engineer, leading a group of software engineers, data scientists, analysts, and quality engineers.

Keywords: Python, Apache Spark, Databricks, Big Data, Machine Learning

##### Software Engineering

*   Extended and improved a system that uses Spark MLLib to make content recommendations for millions of users each day
*   Introduced good software engineering practices on Data Science team, including `git flow`, code reviews, unit and
    system testing, and hiring a dedicated Quality Engineer
*   Transitioned the team from a set of fragile processes to tested workflows that include inline data validation
*   Established explicit SLAs and documented handoff processes for data sets
*   Substantially reduced the complexity of our codebase, unlocking the ability to iterate faster with more confidence
*   Developing systems for producing recommendations in near-real-time, rather than through batch processes

##### Business Impact

*   Managed relationships with internal stakeholders to ensure that data flows into and out of our systems predictably
    and that everyone knows who talk to if something goes wrong
*   Participated in Build vs Buy decisions for multiple technologies

##### Inclusion & Workplace Culture

*   Serving on the Diversity & Inclusion Council, active in several Employee Resource Groups
*   Developed and delivered Engineering Communication workshop ("Pull Requests Without Being a Jerk")
*   Delivered Unconscious Bias training to engineering interviewers

    data from disparate sources for efficient processing of millions of coupons for tens of thousands of merchants
    every half hour.
*   Refined heuristic and machine learning algorithms to determine what order to show those coupons
*   Ensured that the coupon selection and ordering process could scale horizontally to support multiple A/B tests being
    run at once
*   Parallelized algorithm training and processing using producer/consumer model

##### Production Support

*   Providing expertise in Docker, Databases, and Software Engineering to help teams work effectively together
*   Working on a team that has produced a system to analyze news articles for mentions of people being displaced by
    disaster or conflict. [Our project](http://datafordemocracy.org/projects/refugees.html) won a
    [United Nations Unite Ideas](http://ideas.unite.un.org/) competition sponsored by the
