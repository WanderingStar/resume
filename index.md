# Aneel Nazareth

Hi, I'm Aneel. I'm a software developer. I've worked on many different things, ranging from low level code on obscure graphics processors to large scale data processing across clusters of machines. I've made forays into database access, web development, online games, mobile apps, and devops tooling. I'm comfortable writing code that you hold in your hand and code that runs in the cloud in datacenters around the world.

For the last few years, I've been working on a Data Science team. I'm not a Data Scientist, but I'm the guy who makes the data flow. My breadth of experience allows me to design pipelines that get data from newly developed features and legacy applications alike and massage it into something you can use to train a machine learning model or query efficiently. Spot an anomaly in the data and want to know if there's a systemic problem that's feeding bias into your system? I'm happy to dig into codebases written in many languages and figure out where that weird noise is coming from, and whether we can safely filter it out or how to fix the underlying problem.

I also excel at understanding both the business and technical goals of a project and translating between different technical specialties and also less technical stakeholders. I'm able to communicate in ways that respect my audience, but don't assume they share a particular jargon. That communication is key: sometimes there's an elegant technical solution that doesn't quite address the right business problem, or a way that the business goals can be tweaked slightly to drastically reduce technical complexity. I can help find the sweet spots where we can deliver real value.

I strive to improve the quality of the codebases I work with, making them more efficient and at the same time making them more comprehensible. I advocate for careful naming, thorough testing, up-to-date documentation, and code reviews. It's important to share knowledge and make sure that something that seems obvious to the person who wrote it is also clear to someone who'll need to read it in the future. That someone is often me. I'm frequently called in to figure out whether an old or complex piece of code does what it's supposed to, so I've learned the value of investing in maintainability.

I enjoy working with a diverse, tightly-knit, collaborative team. I am also able to coordinate initiatives that stretch beyond my team and span a large organization. I like working with expert peers to design big systems. I also find it rewarding to help less experienced engineers get to the core of a problem, and discover the tools that will help them solve it.

I currently live in Austin, Texas and am not looking to relocate, but am open to remote work on the right team.
